# Welcome
Welcome to the repo of the Computational Modelling project of Dave, Tijn and Pepijn. In this repo we will be answering the 3 following research questions based on a banking dataset:
* To what extent is it possible to predict whether someone will experience payment delays based on all the characteristics of a person and their job, residence, etc.?
* To what extent is it possible to predict whether an application is approved or not based on features of said application?
* To what extent is it possible to find logical clusters of clients (eg. AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, DAYS_EMPLOYED, CNT_FAM_MEMBERS) and/or their loans (eg. AMT_CREDIT, AMT_ANNUITY, AMT_GOODS_PRICE)?

# Setup
Create a folder 'src' in the root of the repo with the following files
* application_data.csv
* columns_description.csv
* previous_applicaton.csv
